This website is very simple. I only used css and html to create it.
Now it's under read-only status.
Maybe the test result will not be always accurate. It's normal. Since we only have 4 questions.
If you want more accurate results, please go to website like www.16personalities.com/

That's all I want to say. It is my first project. Comments are welcomed:)
